# Physiological-Response-to-Temperature-Stress-in-the-Atlantic-Singray

# Purpose of the project
This project aims to analyze the physiological stress response to temperature in Atlantic stingrays (Hypanus sabinus) through respiometry measurements of metabolism.
This project seeks to answer questions about how three different temperatures influence metabolism and how the size and sex of the ray influence metabolism in those different temperatures.

# Each file in the project is intended for
Data holds raw data csv and xslx files for analysis in R
Figs holds figures/models/graphs analyzed from the raw data
Scripts hold analysis code

# How the various files interact
Data is step one (just the raw data), Scripts is step two by writing code that analyzes the raw data, and Figs is step three by holding the resulting graphs/models

# Purpose of specific sections of code
Within the Scripts, my code is separated by the chronological process of analyzing data (1. read data, 2. load required packages, 3. establish formulas and set variables, 4. run calculations, analyze, and plot, etc...)
